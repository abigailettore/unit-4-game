<h1> jQuery Assinment </h1>

In this assignment, a fun and interactive game for web browsers was created. This time, the app  dynamically updates the HTML pages with the jQuery library.

<h2>Ice Cream Collector</h2>


<h3>App Organization</h3>
<p>Here's how the app works:</p>


There will be four pictures of ice cream displayed as buttons on the page.


The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.


When the player clicks on an ice cream cone, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score.

The game will hide this amount until the player clicks an ice cream cone.

When they do click one, the player's score counter will update.


The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.


The player loses if their score goes above the random number.


The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.
